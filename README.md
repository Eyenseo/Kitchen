Kitchen
=======
The project "Kitchen" was part of our second semester at the [Hochschule Bremen](http://www.hs-bremen.de/) in Media Computer Science (Medieninformatik). The goal was to create an interactive, multimedia kitchen based on JavaScript and the canvas-element of HTML5. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and AJAX). Our Kitchen has the topics the elderly and comic - we choose to concentrate on the comic aspect.
